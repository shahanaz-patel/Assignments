		<p>A computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithematic or logical operations.Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed,the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.</p>
		
		<p><h2 id="cpu">cpu</h2></p>
		<p>A central processing unit(CPU),also referred to as a central processor unit,is the hardware within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithematical,logical,and input/output operations of the system.The term has been in use in the computer industry at least since the early 1960s.The form,design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over the course of their history,but their fundamental operation remains much the same. </p>
		
		<p><h2 id="alu">ALU</h2></p>
		<p>In computing,an arithematic and logic unit(ALU) is a digital circuit that performs integer arithematic and logical operations.The ALU is a fundamental building block of the central processing unit of a computer,and even the simple microprocessors contain one for purposes such as maintaining timers.The processors found inside modern CPUs and graphic processing units(GPUs) accommodate very powerful and very complex ALUs;a single component may contain a number of ALUs.</p>

		<p><a href="#overview">GO TO TOP</a></p>
		<p>A programming language is a formal computer language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.</p>
		
		<p><h2 id="c">C</h2></p>
		<p>C is a high-level and general purpose programming language that is ideal for developing firmware or portable applications. Originally intended for writing system software, C was developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie for the Unix Operating System (OS) in the early 1970s.</p>
		
		<p><h2 id="c++">C<sup>++</sup></h2></p>
		<p>C++ is an object oriented programming (OOP) language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, and is an extension of C language. It is therefore possible to code C++ in a "C style" or "object-oriented style."</p>

		<p><a name="dbms"><H1>DBMS</H1></a></p>		
		<p><a href="#overview">GO TO TOP</a></p>
		<p>A database management system (DBMS) is a computer software application that interacts with the user, other applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. A general-purpose DBMS is designed to allow the definition, creation, querying, update, and administration of databases.</p>

		<p><h2 id="rdbms">RDBMS</h2></p>
		<p>A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model as invented by E. F. Codd, of IBM's San Jose Research Laboratory.</p>
		
		<p><h2 id="oodbms">OODBMS</h2></p>
		<p>An object-oriented database management system (OODBMS) is a database management system that supports the creation and modeling of data as objects. OODBMS also includes support for classes of objects and the inheritance of class properties, and incorporates methods, subclasses and their objects.</p>

		<p><h2 id="hdbms">HDBMS</h2></p>
		<p>HDBMS stands for Hierarchical Data Base Management System.</p>

		<p><h2 id="nwdbms">NWDBMS</h2></p>
		<p>A network database is a type of database model wherein multiple member records or files can be linked to multiple owner files and vice versa. The model can be viewed as an upside-down tree where each member information is the branch linked to the owner, which is the bottom of the tree.</p>
